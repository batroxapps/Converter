Converter
=========
An app for Android, allowing you to convert units to another system (eg from metric to imperial) or from for example feet to inches.

Most of the functionality is ready, the only thing that has to be completed is the layout.

Features: - Easy switching between weight, volume, temperature, speed and length.
	- Ability to add presets (WIP, they aren't saved yet and I'm working on the Activity).
	  - Easy switching between imperial and metric.

Optimized for normal screens (470dp x 320dp) at the moment
